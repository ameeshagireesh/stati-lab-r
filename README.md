1. Mean, Median, Mode of Frequency Table 
  - Make sure to find mid value x of each class limit
  - Make sure to reset values of f, by running initial statements (mid+f) again
  
2. 3Ms,Quartile,Range of Random Data
  - 3Ms = Mean+Median+Mode
  - Quartile function is quantile (but don't get confused pls)

3. Plotting sin(x) and cos(x) graphs on the same figure window
  - Adding main title label to the figure window
  - Adding subtitle label to the figure window

4. Linear Regression Equation
  - The owner of a small garment shop is hopeful that his sales are rising significantly
    week by week. Treating the sales for the previous 6 weeks as a typical example of this
